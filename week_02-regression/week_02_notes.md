# Week 02 - Regression

## 2.1. Introduction
To understand regression for machine learning better, this time we will learn and do a project called Car Price Prediction. The goal is to help users in predicting the price of the car based on their input of the car's specification

Here are the steps we will do in conducting the project:
1. Data preparation (the data should be prepared well before we can utilize them)
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Use the linear regression to predict the car price
4. Understanding how linear regression works
5. Evaluating how well the model works using RMSE
6. Feature engineering (how to create or adjusts features to help building the model)
7. Solving possible problems with regularization
8. Tuning the model
9. Using the model
